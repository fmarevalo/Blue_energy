# Blue_energy_Viewer

Blue_energy_Viewer is a Matlab base application for analyzing Salinity Gradient Energy (SGE) potentials for more than a 1000 rivers around the world. The purpose is to easily interact with diferents
rivers and parameters such as Enviromental restrictions and Extraction Discharge to quickly estimate the energy potential that could be extracted from a given river. Ultimatly, the application
aims to became a tool for research, industry agents and policymakers in the growing SGE scenario. 

This application forms part of a joint research funded by Swetch Energy where a main research article "Extended assessment of the globally extractable salinity gradient energy from river mouths" compiles
the findings of the most extensive and exhaustive global assesments of SGE potentials so far. However, a few remarks on the data this application shows is given next:

-River discharge data is presented as multiannual monthly means and is available in " "
-Energy potential data is presented in yield potential for each month and each river and can be found in "  "
-The positions of rivers mouths were manually located
-A operational rule for optimal extraction factor is given and more information about it can be found in "  "

# Install 

The code in this repository is the raw code for running the application and to use it, is necessary Matlab. A standalone version of the application can be found in this Drive Folder " ".


# How to use

To use the application simply select and Enviromental restriction (30% by default) and then select a River of interest. With the sliding bar the Extraction Discharge can be changed. "Desing Discharge" shows
the optimal discharge calculated following the operational rules discribed in " ".
